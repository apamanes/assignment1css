        <h2> About me:</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a person that usually tries its best and respects other people’s 
            beliefs. Sometimes I go out of my way to explore new places and 
            try different ideas than the rest. Through most of my college years,
            I’ve had a good experience with graphic design and computers but right 
            now,  I’m trying to learn new courses based on programming 
            thanks to Coursera so I can have more job opportunities. This site just a short 
            and temporary showcase of my skills and college work. Later on I'll make a better,
            revised portfolio in the future.
        </p>
