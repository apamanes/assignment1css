        <h2>Why go to Japan?</h2>
        <p>
            Japan is a country with a lot of history and culture, from its ancient structures to the modern cities, 
            there’s so much this country has shared to the world. Firstly, as it is part of the Asian continent, 
            one could expect “sure, it’s a modern take of an old world,” or even some people can expect 
            the typical anime and geek stuff this country has pulled out, and both points are true. 
            However, Japan is so much more than that because once you get the hang of how the city works, 
            you’ll see why this nation really stands out from other Asian countries, 
            and it’s a testament to many of the wonders of our planet.

        <h2> Do I need to rent a car? </h2>
        <p>
            Answer: no. To Japanese citizens, having a car is optional, but the country is perfectly 
            suited for public transport to anyone: there’s taxis, buses, ferries, planes, and most importantly, 
            metros and trains. Japan is heavily connected by railways and it’s the most effective way to move from 
            one place to another. The Shinkansen, or bullet trains, are of the fastest, hi-tech, most dynamic trains in 
            the world; people can go to one state to another in a matter of hours. Airports are also an option, 
            but traveling by train is the most effective method. When you’re in Japan, you’d better plan 
            where you’re going and study the metros and trains, so you experience less delays on your journey. 
            One mistake and you’ll end up farther from your destination point.

        <h2> What to eat? </h2>
        <p>
            Japan eats in a completely different way than what you know in America and Europe. Most of their food 
            is based around rice, seafood, noodles, beef, and even pork. Japanese people do tend to balance their meals with 
            plenty of exercise and walking a day, but people outside of the country can’t eat the same things they do. 
            So, if you have certain allergies or intolerances, make a good search on what restaurants you’ll eat, 
            ask the chef to remove anything you need, and avoid street food when possible. 
            Make sure the hotels you book have options of breakfast you’re more familiar with. 
            There are plenty of hotel chains and luxury ones that have eggs and many other breakfast options, 
            as well as the Japanese ones. And don’t forget to treat yourself when you can!

        <h2> What places should I visit? </h2>
        <p>
        Whether you’re into geek culture, exploring landscapes or both, there’s just so many things you can do that 
        it’s hardly possible to complete everything in one trip. You’re going to walk a lot, so you’ll need to take breaks. 
        As an opinion, the most essential places to visit are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Shibyua Crossing, Tokyo</li>
            <li>2. Tokyo Sky Tree, Tokyo</li>
            <li>3. Peace Park & Memorial Museum, Hiroshima</li>
            <li>4. Nijo Castle, Kyoto</li>
            <li>5. Nishiki Market, Kyoto</li>
            <li>6. Kyoto Sento Imperial Palace, Kyoto</li>
            <li>7. Fushimi Inari Shrine, Kyoto</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Places such as Tokyo Disneyland, Super Nintendo World, or even the Ghibli parks might not be as essential
            because of all the historical and national places. So, we recommend you do a first visit to Japan 
            to see all national treasures and a second visit later to see all the pop culture stuff. 
            Also pack some comfortable shoes and drink enough water and electrolytes because you’ll 
            walk a lot through streets, stairs, and mounts. The season will depend on a lot in your journey, 
            because summers and winters in the country can be intense, so spring and fall are the best times 
            to visit according to most visitors. <br> <br> If you want to know more information on Japan, click on the link below:
